  
 The below steps discribe how to create new service account in order to use it in Jenkins to push docker images to openshift registry
 
 1) Login to Openshift cluster:
  
        oc login https://master.cload.com:8443 --token=HYcccccc4I8vbcNnNc
        
  2) Switch to the project that you want to push the docker images under it, lets say mkharma project
    oc project mkharma
  
  3) Create new service account, 
    oc create serviceaccount jenkins
  
  4) add role 'edit' to the user, this rolle will be effective only within the selected project
     oc policy add-role-to-user system:image-pusher system:serviceaccount:mkharma:jenkinssa -n mkharma
 OR
 grant cluster access to the service account to access all projects
 
      oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user system:image-pusher jenkins
     
  5) Get token string in order to use it in the external Jenkins
      oc serviceaccounts get-token jenkins -n mkharma


In case you need additional roles to manage openshift externaly from Jenkins, you can add the appropriate role according to the need.
